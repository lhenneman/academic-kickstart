I am driven to solve complex environmental problems through collaboration with experts in multiple fields and environmental stakeholders, while emphasizing the role of data and modern tools for data science. In particular, I am interested in Air Pollution Accountability, a field that tries to answer the question ‘Was it all worth it?’ in regard to air quality regulations. 

I prioritize communication with stakeholders affected by the links in the Accountability Chain (if you’re one of them, please reach out!), and I hope that my efforts will contribute to continued implementation of scientifically sound policies throughout the world.

In pursuing this research, I investigate relationships between links along the Chain of Accountability (figure below). This framework describes how regulations impact emissions, air quality, personal dose/exposure, and ultimately public health. Though we can measure changes at each of these links, the relationships that accountability researchers are interested in (blue portions of the arrows) are clouded by other factors (red portions), making it difficult to causally attribute changes at any link to air quality regulations.
